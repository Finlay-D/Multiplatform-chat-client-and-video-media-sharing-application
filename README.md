This project was part of a module in the University of Strathclyde.

The project is based off the discord application and allwos clients to communicate with each other through a server client.

The program includes a number of features, including:

	*Server-Side editable profiles for each client, which are viewable by all clients.
    *Group chat functions, allowing >2 clients to communicate with each other at once.
    *Asynchronous messaging system, saving messages while the recipient is offline.
    *Client vs Client games such as hangman
	
The project was focused on the thread-safety of concurrent programs, thus there is a threadsafe, and non-threadsafe version of every feature in the code.

The code should be run on two clients to show the communication between them.
